I tried many approaches: creating xml in ~/.local/share/mime/packages and using assogiate app, nothing works for me, most guides are outdated and not working for the latest ubuntu build.

the request is very simple, I want to change icon for *.docx files, how may I do that?

$ grep docx /etc/mime.types 
application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document         docx





libreoffice - I cannot set as default program libre office instead of wps for docx files only - Ask Ubuntu

Pulled from here, use your editor of choice (and sudo/gksudo, thanks Weboide) to modify /usr/share/applications/defaults.list to have the following line:

application/docx=wps-office-wps.desktop

For all the other file types relating to Office programs (e.g. xls, doc), you can set a different editor e.g.

application/xlsx=libreoffice-writer.desktop
