Do you have wps-office installed? If yes, you can move or delete these:

/usr/share/mime/packages/wps-office-et.xml
/usr/share/mime/packages/wps-office-wpp.xml
/usr/share/mime/packages/wps-office-wps.xml
they seem to have invalid content to identify a doc(x) document.

/usr/share/mime/packages/wps-fallidos/
