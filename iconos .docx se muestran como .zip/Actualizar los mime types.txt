The /usr/share/mime directory and its /usr/share/mime/packages subdirectory are provided by package shared-mime-info so to fix the error it should be sufficient to re-install the package - either from your favorite GUI package manager or from the command line using

sudo apt-get install --reinstall shared-mime-info


If you want to restore /usr/share/mime-info and /usr/share/mimelnk as well, then they appear to belong to libreoffice-common

Other packages may have installed their own files underneath /usr/share/mime - to identify these, you can use

dpkg -S /usr/share/mime
